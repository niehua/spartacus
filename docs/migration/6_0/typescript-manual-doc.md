<!--
  Most typescript breaking changes should be detected and documented automatically by a script if a change is apparent when comparing the public API of the previous version vs the public API of the new major version.

  This file should contain typescript change documentation for changes not immediately apparent while comparing the public api between the older release and the current release and therefore will not be detected by the breaking change detection script.

  Examples of typescript breaking changes that are not detectable by the script are:
    * High level changes or refactoring
    * Behaviour changes that are not backwards compatible and worth mentioning

## SSR and Prerendering

If you are using prerendering, you will need to provide the following function to your `AppServerModule`:

```ts
import { provideServer } from '@spartacus/setup/ssr';
@NgModule({
  ...
  providers: [
    ...provideServer({
      serverRequestOrigin: process.env['SERVER_REQUEST_ORIGIN'],
    }),
    ...
  ],
})
export class AppServerModule {}
```

It is _mandatory_ to set the `serverRequestOrigin` option for the prerendering, as it can not be automatically resolved.

In SSR mode, it will be automatically resolved from the express server, therefore it doesn't have to be set via this option.
If explicitly set, this option will take precedence over the express server.
